# Terraform
Terraform is an open-source tool created by HashiCorp that allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It's a powerful and flexible tool designed to manage infrastructure as code (IaC), which means that infrastructure is defined and managed using code rather than manual processes.
